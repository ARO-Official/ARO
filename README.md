# ARO（Aurora big data analysis platform） 

### Blockchain-based mobile internet big data information service platform.
From the perspective of technology, ARO starts with the concept analysis of big data, explores data platform for analyzing and processing big data. and applies blockchain technology in the construction and configuration of big data from the perspective of combining theory and practice to achieve true communion.

At the same time, it combines mobile communication technology, data processing theory and database programming technology, and completes the Hadoop platform composition and common component descriptions and the actual construction and configuration of the platform. Hadoop operation commands, Hive analysis commands and other data analysis algorithms, and uses Hadoop platform and its components Hive to process and analyze the massive information and business data in the mobile network.

ARO solves the needs of different types of big data analysis in mobile networks:

Calculation of network key indicators (KPI); calculation of user perception index (S-KPI); user terminal information statistics.


### Origins
ARO public chain is the first application section of the pan-financial ecosystem jointly established by ARO's blockchain-based big data information service platform (Aurora mobile Internet big data information service platform) and the United States Credit Blockchain Foundation (USA CREDIT BLOCK CHAIN FOUNDATION).

### Technology
ARO has invested a lot of resources in developer tools to provide DAPP developers with more potential development capabilities. And achieve end-to-end data transparency, reduce costs and risks, and effectively solve the information island phenomenon. Realize the global circulation of data value.

The ARO basic network layer is composed of a data layer and a network layer. The ARO framework is designed with a multi-level node system. Different storage strategies (distributed accounting) are selected according to different node applications. The advantage of a multi-level node system is that it does not want all nodes to participate in bookkeeping (mining), store complete data, and relay transactions. Because not all nodes have common requirements and want to save complete data, ARO design allows the entire system to have a clear division of roles, and professional nodes do professional things, which not only saves energy but also improves the efficiency of the entire system.

The intermediate protocol layer is composed of a consensus layer, an incentive layer, and a token layer. The P2P Protocol (P2P Protocol) supports data transmission and signaling exchange of each node in the blockchain network. It is an important communication guarantee reached by the data distribution or consensus mechanism. ARO system design supports the configuration of multiple P2P protocols, communication mechanisms, and serialization mechanisms. It requires flexible protocol needs to be used. In terms of communication security, it can flexibly support secure communication protocols such as HTTPS, TLS, and SWS (Secure Web Sockets), and has developed VTP and VHTTP by itself to achieve certain guarantees for the efficiency and security of the public chain. On the need to establish a platform application external service interface, it can be extended to support OAuth authentication integration.

The design of the consensus mechanism needs to be sufficiently decentralized to achieve security, and high operating speed is required to ensure performance.

ARO uses POP (Proof of Powers) consensus algorithm + Genetic Algorithm.

The PoP consensus algorithm combines the ideas of PoI and DPoS, which can not only ensure the fairness of the device, but also have the consensus of the community. By taking the amount of rights records acquired in the past as a reference, the greater the amount of historical records, the greater the right to obtain accounting.

Continuous access to recording rights: other nodes (the ones with lower rights) who want to obtain the rights to record data only need to increase the computing power, which makes the calculation speed increase, and the difficulty of obtaining the recording rights of the current block is reduced; nodes with large rights may not be able to obtain the right to record before other nodes that have improved computing power.

Genetic Algorithm is a computational model that simulates the natural selection process of Darwin's biological evolution and the evolutionary mechanism of genetics. It is a method of searching for the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution process.

Incentive layer. Because ARO's unique consensus mechanism and full-node network layout, performance is not affected by the number of nodes, so the consensus node of ARO has no upper limit and is dynamically developed. Anyone can earn rewards at any time.

Token layer. For each token, as a financial asset running full life cycle management on the blockchain, complete and controllable process management of the submission, deployment, use, and cancellation of the token.  And an integrated authority management mechanism for the operation of the token , the various mechanisms for comprehensive safety management.

Application layer. The biggest feature of the application layer is that it can provide a common transaction protocol, support multi-language integration and function expansion.

One after another, it will support multiple languages ​​such as Java, JavaScript, and Python, and a general integrity agreement.This set of agreements is not just an application of Internet Finance's integrity agreement.

As the most important application link in the digital economy, the ARO application service layer includes various application scenarios and cases of blockchain, including programmable currency, programmable finance, and programmable society. The application layer is the underlying technical architecture of the ARO application ecosystem. The open source programmable application layer provides technical guarantee for the establishment of a global digital economy application ecosystem.
